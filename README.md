## Capstone Project for DSI at General Assembly

This repository contains notebooks and associated files for my capstone project completed during the Data Science Immersive course at General Assembly (London, UK).

### Project Goals
Book ratings give an incomplete picture of what consumers think of books, which can make it difficult to improve marketing strategies for publishers or retailers. The main goal of this project is to identify common topics in text reviews of books using topic modelling, and to determine whether developing distinct marketing strategies to promote books based on their genre would be an effective strategy to pursue. A secondary goal of the project is to train and test a topic model capable of predicting the main topics of text reviews.

The findings of this project may have interesting business outcomes for publishers and retailers as they could enable more effective marketing strategies for different books should distinct topics be identified across book genres. For example, fantasy readers may care more about character personalities than sci-fi readers and thus marketing materials for fantasy books could be adjusted accordingly. Conversely, if book genres are not identified in review topics, this could indicate that investing resources in creating promotion materials for distinct book genres is an unnecessary expense.
