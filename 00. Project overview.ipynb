    "    Book ratings give an incomplete picture of what consumers think of books, which can make it difficult to improve marketing strategies for publishers or retailers. The main goal of this project is to identify common topics in text reviews of books using topic modelling, and to determine whether developing distinct marketing strategies to promote books based on their genre would be an effective strategy to pursue. A secondary goal of the project is to train and test a topic model capable of predicting the main topics of text reviews.<br><br>\n",
    "    The findings of this project may have interesting business outcomes for publishers and retailers as they could enable more effective marketing strategies for different books should distinct topics be identified across book genres. For example, fantasy readers may care more about character personalities than sci-fi readers and thus marketing materials for fantasy books could be adjusted accordingly. Conversely, if book genres are not identified in review topics, this could indicate that investing resources in creating promotion materials for distinct book genres is an unnecessary expense.\n",

The main approach used to determine whether or not the LDA models used performed adequately was by inspection of the topics it produced (whether they were sensible), and the degree of overlap across topics as determined visually using LDAvis<sup>4</sup>. To compare the performance of different LDA models, I also used perplexity and coherence scores as metrics to determine which LDA model performed best. Additional information on these metrics can be found in notebook #5.\n",

This model produced topics that were interpretable, with some overlap but overall low perplexity and acceptable topic coherence. It can now be used to predict topics in book reviews.<br><br>\n",
    "     The key findings of this modelling exercise are that some themes common to specific book genres do come across as topics in the topic model, for example magic, love and courtship, story plots or adventure. This indicates that it may be worth developing distinct marketing strategies for fantasy, romance, thriller books in particular. Another finding is that target audiences also come up as topics, in particular children and young adult, indicating that books for this demographic range should be promoted in a way that targets this specific audience. An important potential limitation to bear in mind when interpreting these findings is that topics were manually labelled, and that there may be some bias imparted by the person labelling them.\n",
